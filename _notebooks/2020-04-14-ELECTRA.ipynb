You get a rough idea of what it could be. The input is again corrupted but instead of masking, the tokens are replaced by other tokens. and the task is to detect whether a token(a word represented by a number) is genuine or corrupted(real or fake). A new self-supervised task for language representation learning.\n",

The advantage is that the model gets to learn from all tokens, not just the masked out small sub-set. However, one thing to note here is that the training is not adversarial. The model is trained with maximum likelihood rather than adversarial loss due to the difficulty of applying GAN to text."
